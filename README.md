# Tankless Dawn of War: Dark Crusade
(Yes, it's 2017 and I still play that game!)

A mod for Dark Crusade that reduces vehicles. Simple and easy.

This mod was born out of my enjoyment of playing only with infantry. Removing
completely vehicles would not be fair, as some races' relic unit is a vehicle
so too keep the balance the vehicle cap is set to 5 (10 for Orks).


## Installing
Place the TanklessMod folder in your Dark Crusade folder, then activate from
the game manager, in the game main menu.
