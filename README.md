# Tankless Down of War: Dark Crusade
(Yes, it's 2016 and I still play that game!)

A mod for Dark Crusade that removes vehicles. Simple and easy.

Why? I enjoy playing infantry and find it actually more interesting than just getting vehicles and blasting things and while I do that, the computer almost never really agrees. And it's not nice getting dreadsies in your base on insane with no vehicles.
